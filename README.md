Looking for a job as a QA Tester

I'm learning how to test websites and apps on Android.
Completed training and practical application of acquired skills in the Utest system.

Open to new experiences and professional challenges. I am looking for stationary, hybrid, or remote work that will enable me to develop and expand my current qualifications and interests, gain experience, and learn new skills.
